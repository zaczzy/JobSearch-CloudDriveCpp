How to run the code :
DO a make in the root folder. It will make all the components of the system.

There are following components of the system which need to be run simultaneously:
1. Backend storage server
$ ./storage_server config_master.txt group_no server_no -v
Config file used: config_master.txt

2. Frontend server
$ ./fes server no
config file used : config_fes.txt

3. Load balancer
$ ./lb
config file used : config_fes.txt

4. Front end on the browser
localhost:7000

5. Admin server
config file used : config.txt
The format is the same as the backend server but the port no should be different. 
The port no needs to be calculated as (1200 * group_no) + server_no. This port number has to be added in the config file.
Admin server needs to be made separately. So, go to admin folder and type make. And then run it using the following command:
$ ./admin

To run on the browser:
localhost:6007
